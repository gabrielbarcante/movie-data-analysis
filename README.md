# The Movie Database Analysis
## Description
This is the second project of the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program from Udacity. I will analyze The Movie Database (TMDb), which is a dataset that contains informations about 10,000 movies, trying to answer the following questions:
* Which genres are most popular from year to year?
* What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
<br><br>

## Files used
I will use the `tmdb-movies.csv` dataset to do my analysis, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1612835584596000&usg=AOvVaw2ZhHzXEdJduKsjXj0GmPmc). This dataset is provided by Udacity and was cleaned from the original data on [Kaggle](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1612835584597000&usg=AOvVaw2HT1VvW9gZDk6WJAFblxCP).
